# pidusage

Cross-platform process cpu % and memory usage of a PID for golang

Ideas from https://github.com/soyuka/pidusage but just use Golang

## API

```golang
package main

import (
	"os"
	"github.com/bingoohuang/braft/pidusage"
)

func printStat() {
	sysInfo, err := pidusage.GetStat(os.Getpid())
}
```

## How it works

A check on the `runtime.GOOS` is done to determine the method to use.

### Linux

We use `/proc/{pid}/stat` in addition to the the `PAGE_SIZE` and the `CLK_TCK` directly from `getconf()` command. Uptime
comes from `proc/uptime`

Cpu usage is computed by
following [those instructions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16726779/how-do-i-get-the-total-cpu-usage-of-an-application-from-proc-pid-stat/16736599#16736599)
. It keeps an history of the current processor time for the given pid so that the computed value gets more and more
accurate. Don't forget to do `unmonitor(pid)` so that history gets cleared. Cpu usage does not check the child process
tree!

Memory result is representing the RSS (resident set size) only by doing `rss*pagesize`, where `pagesize` is the result
of `getconf PAGE_SIZE`.

### On darwin, freebsd, solaris

We use a fallback with the `ps -o pcpu,rss -p PID` command to get the same information.

Memory usage will also display the RSS only, process cpu usage might differ from a distribution to another. Please check
the corresponding `man ps` for more insights on the subject.

### On AIX

AIX is tricky because I have no AIX test environment, at the moment we use: `ps -o pcpu,rssize -p PID` but `/proc`
results should be more accurate! If you're familiar with the AIX environment and know how to get the same results as we'
ve got with Linux systems.

### Windows

Next version will support
